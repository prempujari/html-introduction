# Learn HTML
## This project is to teach others HTML
This document will explain the code in index.html and if you go to [http://prempujari.github.io/html101/ ] ( http://prempujari.github.io/html101/) you can see some of the code in action.

Your **first step** is to get a text editor. There are two text editors I recommend. I personally use [Atom Text Editor] (https://atom.io). My second favorite text editor is [Sublime] (http://www.sublimetext.com) .

Your **second step** is to open the test editor and start typing away. Make sure you save your file as filename.html.

###HTML 101 begins here:
`<!DOCTYPE html>`
